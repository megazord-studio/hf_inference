# Remote Inference Cleanup - October 15, 2025

## Summary
All files related to the remote inference server feature have been removed from the project.

## Files Removed

### Python Files
- ✅ `app/services/remote_inference_service.py` - Remote inference service implementation
- ✅ `app/services/__pycache__/remote_inference_service.cpython-312.pyc` - Cached bytecode
- ✅ `debug_remote.py` - Debug script for testing remote connection
- ✅ `test_remote_inference.py` - Test script for remote inference
- ✅ `test_remote_models.py` - Test script for remote model discovery

### Configuration Files
- ✅ `.env.example` - Example environment configuration for remote setup
- ✅ `setup_remote.sh` - Shell script for setting up remote inference

### Documentation Files
- ✅ `REMOTE_INFERENCE.md` - User guide for remote inference
- ✅ `REMOTE_INFERENCE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Technical implementation details
- ✅ `REMOTE_INFERENCE_UI.md` - UI documentation for remote inference
- ✅ `REMOTE_MODEL_DISCOVERY.md` - Documentation for remote model fetching
- ✅ `FINAL_SUMMARY.md` - Complete summary of remote inference integration

## Verification

### Code References Checked
- ✅ No references to `use_remote` in Python files
- ✅ No references to `include_remote` in Python files
- ✅ No references to `REMOTE_INFERENCE` environment variables in code
- ✅ No references to remote inference in JavaScript files
- ✅ No references to remote inference in HTML templates
- ✅ No references to `megazord` or `inference.kube` URLs in application code

### Remaining Files
The only "remote" references left are in:
- Library dependencies (torch, diffusers) - these are normal and unrelated to your remote inference feature
- `trust_remote_code=True` parameters in `app/runners/image_text_to_text.py` - this is a HuggingFace parameter, not related to your remote server

## Current State
✅ **Clean** - All remote inference server code and documentation has been removed.

The application now runs purely with local inference (or can use HuggingFace API directly with rate limiting handled via stale cache).

## Environment Files
- `.env` - Currently empty (safe to keep for future use)
- No `.env.example` - Removed as it was only for remote inference configuration

## Next Steps
If you need environment variables in the future, you can create a new `.env.example` with just the variables you need (like `HF_TOKEN` for HuggingFace API access).
