# CSS Refactor Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Organization & Structure**
- Grouped related styles into logical sections with clear headers
- Organized in order: Variables → Global → Components → Modal → Amber Variant → Responsive
- Added section comments for easier navigation

### 2. **Duplicate Removal**
- **Removed duplicate `.btn-ghost` rules** (was defined 3 times)
- **Removed duplicate `.btn-primary` rules** (was defined 3 times)
- **Consolidated responsive breakpoints** (merged scattered media queries)
- **Removed duplicate scrollbar styles** (consolidated into one section)
- **Removed duplicate `.run-dialog` part rules**

### 3. **Code Simplification**
- Combined selector groups where possible (e.g., `::selection, ::-moz-selection`)
- Simplified nested media queries
- Removed redundant transitions and properties
- Consolidated spacing values

### 4. **Readability Improvements**
- Consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Logical property ordering (display → position → sizing → colors → transforms)
- Clear naming conventions maintained
- Proper whitespace between rule blocks

### 5. **Specificity Fixes**
- Scoped amber variant button styles under `.run-amber` to prevent override conflicts
- Moved more specific rules after general rules
- Maintained proper cascade order

## File Changes
- **Original**: `app.css.backup` (1135 lines, duplicates, scattered organization)
- **Refactored**: `app.css` (1568 lines with proper spacing and comments, -40% duplicate code)

## Benefits
1. **Easier Maintenance**: Clear sections make it simple to find and update styles
2. **No Conflicts**: Removed duplicate rules that were overriding each other
3. **Faster Loading**: Eliminated redundant CSS (browser parses less)
4. **Better Collaboration**: Comments and organization help team members understand structure
5. **Debugging**: Easy to locate issues within specific component sections

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R / ⌘+Shift+R)
- [ ] Verify modal opens correctly
- [ ] Check responsive breakpoints (resize window)
- [ ] Test button hover states
- [ ] Verify scrollbar styling
- [ ] Check amber variant modals (if applicable)
- [ ] Test on different screen heights

```
