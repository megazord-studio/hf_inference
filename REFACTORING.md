# Code Refactoring Summary

This document explains changes made to improve code readability while keeping all functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Extracted Task Schemas** (commit 0984cf6)
- **Problem**: hf_models.py was becoming bloated with inline schema definitions
- **Solution**: Created `app/task_schemas.py` with all task UI schemas
- **Benefits**: 
  - Cleaner separation of concerns
  - Easier to maintain and update schemas
  - Better organized with helper functions

### 2. **Removed Empty Documentation Files**
- Deleted `CSS_REFACTOR_NOTES.md` and `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` (were empty placeholders)
- Keeping documentation minimal and focused

### 3. **Code Structure**
The key new feature added since last online commit (ae3e81b) is the **Inference Modal System**:
- **Frontend**: `app/static/js/inference.js` (985 lines) - handles the interactive inference UI
- **Backend**: `/run` endpoint in `app/routes/hf_models.py` - provides task schemas
- **Templates**: `app/templates/inference_modal.html` - modal structure
- **Styling**: Enhanced CSS in `app/static/css/app.css`

## Architecture

```
User clicks "Run" on a model
  ↓
Frontend calls GET /run?task=<task>
  ↓
Backend returns schema (from task_schemas.py)
  ↓
Frontend renders form based on schema
  ↓
User fills form and submits
  ↓
Frontend calls POST /inference with FormData
  ↓
Backend runs the model and returns results
```

## File Organization

- **`app/task_schemas.py`**: UI schema definitions for all tasks
- **`app/routes/hf_models.py`**: HTTP endpoints (models list, schema endpoint, HTML page)
- **`app/static/js/inference.js`**: Inference modal JavaScript logic
- **`app/runners/__init__.py`**: Runner registry (simple eager loading)
- **`app/runners/*.py`**: Individual task runner implementations

## Principles Applied

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Schemas separate from route handlers
2. **Simplicity**: Removed lazy loading complexity, kept eager loading
3. **Readability**: Added docstrings, clear naming, consistent formatting
4. **Functionality Preserved**: All features from "latest version" still work

## What's the Same

- All 30+ task types still supported
- Runner implementations unchanged (except minor import fixes)
- Error handling and caching logic preserved
- API responses unchanged
